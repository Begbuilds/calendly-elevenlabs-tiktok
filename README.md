## ü§î How It Works

The integration connects Elevenlabs' voice agents with your Calendly account through a backend server:

1. Caller phones your Elevenlabs voice agent number
2. The voice agent uses webhook functions to check your Calendly availability
3. Caller selects a meeting type and preferred time
4. System sends booking link via SMS for final confirmation
5. Appointment is added to your Calendly calendar when confirmed
